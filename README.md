# Statistics
Basic statistic's for Data analytics 

Statistics, in general, is the method of collection of data, tabulation, and interpretation of numerical data.
It is an area of applied mathematics concerned with data collection analysis, interpretation, and presentation. 
With statistics, we can see how data can be used to solve complex problems.I use two different dataset for this statistics analysis 

Mean , Median , Mode , Permutations and Combinations ,Quantile , Simple random sample , systematic sample , cluster sampling , mean cluster sampling,
startified random sample ,  Probability Distribution [binominal distrubution , poisson distribution , uniform distribution]

Measure of Central Tendency
The measure of central tendency is a single value that attempts to describe the whole set of data. There are three main features of central tendency:
*) Mean
*) Median
*) Mode

Mean  
It is the sum of observations divided by the total number of observations. It is also defined as average which is the sum divided by count. 

Median 
It is the middle value of the data set. It splits the data into two halves. If the number of elements in the data set is odd then the center element is the median and if it is even then the median would be the average of two central elements. it first sorts the data i=and then performs the median operation

Mode
It is the value that has the highest frequency in the given data set. The data set may have no mode if the frequency of all data points is the same. Also, we can have more than one mode if we encounter two or more data points having the same frequency. 

Permutation
It is the distinct interpretations of a provided number of components carried one by one, or some, or all at a time. For example, if we have two components A and B, then there are two likely performances, AB and BA. A numeral of permutations when ‘r’ components are positioned out of a total of ‘n’ components is n Pr = n! / (n – r)!. For example, let n = 3 (A, B, and C) and r = 2 (All permutations of size 2). The answer is 3!/(3 – 2)! = 6. The six permutations are AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, and CB.

Combination
It is the distinct sections of a shared number of components carried one by one, or some, or all at a time. For example, if there are two components A and B, then there is only one way to select two things, select both of them.
Number of combinations when ‘r’ components are chosen out of a total of ‘n’ components is, nCr = n! / [(r!) x (n – r)!]. For example, let n = 3 (A, B, and C) and r = 2 (All combinations of size 2). The answer is 3!/((3 – 2)! × 2!) = 3. The six combinations are AB, AC, and BC.

Sampling
Sampling plays a major role in the form of staistics, Sampling means selecting the group that you will actually collect data from in your research.

Simple random sample 
An example of a simple random sample would be the names of 25 employees being chosen out of a hat from a company of 250 employees. In this case, the population is all 250 employees, and the sample is random because each employee has an equal chance of being chosen.

Systematic sample 
In which a random sample, with a fixed periodic interval, is selected from a larger population. The fixed periodic interval, called the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.

Probability Distrubution 
A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the probability of different possible values of a variable. Probability distributions are often depicted using graphs or probability tables.
